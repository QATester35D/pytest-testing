# pytest-testing
Python code repository for working with pytest

This is a practice training repository to work with pytest and write test automation scripts in Python.

Project: To create a repository like a real environment with source code and test automation scripts. This will incorporate testing scenarios/interactions across numerous web based objects that could be encountered. Several websites will be used to include:

- https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/web/
- https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/
- https://jqueryui.com/draggable/

I will be following the structure of having tests reside outside the application code base. This approach has the tests residing with the appication code base in the overall repository but within a separate folder structure for organizational purposes and easy of running the entire test suite in a CI environment.

The "src" folder will simulate where an application's code base would reside.
The "tests" folder is where the various pytest scripts would reside.
